# 🤖 Digital Twin Confessor

> *“A space where your digital twin speaks the truths you leave unspoken.”*

## 🧠 What is This?

**Digital Twin Confessor** is a Streamlit-based AI tool that takes your written text (like tweets, notes, or blogs) and generates a **confession** — a personal or emotional reflection — as if spoken by an AI version of you.

This "digital twin" reads your thoughts and reveals what you *might* really feel deep inside — even if you never said it out loud.

## 💬 What does "Confess" mean here?

“**Confess**” means your digital twin (the AI) expresses an emotional or hidden truth based on the text you share. It’s not just summarizing — it’s reflecting your **inner voice** in a soft, human way.

### 📝 Example:

**Input Text:**

> "I just posted my blog. I hope people like it."
